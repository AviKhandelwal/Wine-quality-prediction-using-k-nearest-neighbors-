# Wine-quality-prediction-using-k-nearest-neighbors-

Vinho verde is a unique product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. Medium in alcohol, is it particularly appreciated due to its freshness (specially in the summer). Two datasets are included, related to red and white wine samples and the goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

## Attribute Information:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Implementations -
Part A. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (For better understanding of data-set)

Part B. K Nearest Neibours Algorithm (KNN) (For classification)

Part C. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ( For reducing the number of features, from scratch)

Part D. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (For reducing the number of features, using sklearn)
